In an application, the spacing of elements should be designed, should not be random. Consistent spacing can improve the quality of UI design and let users feel the professionalism of the product. Styliâ€™s default layout has `4px` as the basic unit, and all spaces are multiples of `4px`. It is recommended that all components and text layouts use these regular spaces.

## Spacing config

Styli uses `4px` as the spacing unit by default. Of course, you can configure your own spacing. You can modify the default spacing by modifying `theme.spacing`.

```jsx
const myPreset = {
  theme: {
    spacing: [0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36],
  },
}
```

## Usage

How to use the spacing? Use it by Atomic props like `p{spacing}`, `m{spacing}`, `w{spacing}`, `h{spacing}`, `s{spacing}`, `c{spacing}`.

For an example:

```jsx live
<View toCenterX>
  <View s-100 bgRed400 mr2></View>
  <View s-100 bgYellow40 mr2></View>
  <View s-100 bgGreen400></View>
</View>
```

The `mr2` in the above example, it is the preset spacing in the design system, which is equivalent `to margin-right: 8px`.

Spacing can be used in five attributes: `padding`, `margin`, `width`, `height`, `size`, `circle`, for example, you can use these attributes, `p2`, `mx2`, `w4`, `h4`, `s8`, `c8`, And you can enjoy the perfect type prompt.

## Compare with precise value

In some cases, the spacing of the design system cannot meet your UI needs. This is a more flexible way you can use: **precise values**. Any value can be set through the middle bar `-`, such as the following `s-100`, `mr-20`, will produce styles `width: 100px; height: 100px`, `margin-right: 20px`:

```jsx live
<View toCenterX>
  <View s-100 bgRed400 mr-20></View>
  <View s-100 bgYellow40 mr-20></View>
  <View s-100 bgGreen400></View>
</View>
```

In most cases, it is recommended to use regular spacing in the project, which will make your UI more design and rhythmic.
