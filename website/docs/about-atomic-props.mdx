Inspired by [Atomic CSS](https://acss.io/) and [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/), Fower uses Atomic props to write styles. So what are atomic properties? I think you must know CSS atomic classes. They look like this: `.p-2`, `.m-10`, `.bg-green`, `.flex`... Atomic properties and CSS atomic classes are very Similar, except that it is not written in className, but directly in Markup.

Atomic props can be written in HTML:

```jsx
<div bgRed300 text3XL>
  Fower
</div>
```

It can also be written in custom components:

```jsx live
<Box bgRed300 text3XL>
  Fower
</Box>
```

To put it simply, the atomic props is the **style unit** that acts on the UI Markup.

## Different with CSS atomic classes?

As mentioned above, atomic properties and atomic classes are very similar. What is the difference between them? I think the biggest difference is: Atomic props are dynamic, while atomic classes are static.

Let's take padding as an example. Its CSS atomic class can have `.p-1`, `.p-2`, `p-4`, `p-5`... It is an enumeration and is limited. Since CSS atomic classes are static, you need to write a lot of code. , Its CSS code is easy to swell, and a padding-related atomic class may require thousands of lines of code.

## Different with inline style?

- **Less code**, the amount of inline style code is larger, it is easy to make JSX messy, "Atomic props" retains the conciseness of JSX and is more readable.

- **Style reuse**, use inline styles, styles cannot be reused, use "Atomic props", styles are reused, and the code size will not expand too much with the development of the project.

## Why use Atomic props

- **Scoped style**

  The traditional CSS classes are global, and it is easy for styles to affect each other when developing in a team. Fower uses atomic attributes to write styles, and atomic attributes eventually generate unique atomic class names, and there is no problem of styles affecting each other.

- **Design system**

  It is easy to create a design system by using Atomic props.
