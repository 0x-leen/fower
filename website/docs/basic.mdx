## Basic usage

In order to give you a deeper understanding of the usage of Styli, let's review the basic usage:

```jsx live
<Text f-24 fontBold green500>
  Hi, Styli
</Text>
```

The simplest way to use Styli is to set some Atomic Props directly on the Styli component. The Atomic Props `f-24`, `fontBold`, `green500` will produce the following style:

```jsx live
<span
  style={{
    fontSize: '24px',
    fontWeight: 'bold',
    color: '#48bb78',
  }}
>
  Hi, Styli
</span>
```

The Atomic Props above `f-24`, `fontBold`, `green500`, no need to declare a value for them, we call it the "**Key as Value**" pattern, which makes the UI code more concise and improves the development experience. Personally I believe that the JSX inline style itself is already very good. It has strong types and is convenient for dynamic styles. The biggest disadvantage is cumbersome and visually disturbing. No one likes ugly boilerplate code like `style={{}}`. Styli solves these problems. With Styli, every character is meaningful, there are no unnecessary characters such as equal signs, curly braces, and quotation marks, and the structure of JSX is kept clean.

> The `f` in `f-24` is the abbreviation of fontSize. For more conciseness and development efficiency, we will simplify the high-frequency Atomic Props such as `margin`, `padding`, `width`, `heigth`, `fontSize`, `color` to one character.

## Use attr value

In most cases, we recommend write the style with the "**Key as Value**" pattern. In some scenarios, we need to set the attribute value to write the style:

```jsx live
function Demo() {
  const a = 5
  const b = 5
  return (
    <Text f={30} p={a + b} bg="#bee3f8" fontBold>
      Hi, Styli
    </Text>
  )
}
```

The **value** mode loses some of its simplicity, but is more flexible, and is especially suitable for dynamic style scenes.
