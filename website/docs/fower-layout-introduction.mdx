Fower provides a powerful Flexbox-based layout toolkit. By adjusting the direction and alignment of the layout, you can build most of the layout and make the layout easier.

Compared with the traditional flex layout, the layout of Fower is more abstract and streamlined. The layout of Fower is abstracted as `toCenter`, `toCenterX`, `toCenterY`, `toLeft`, `toTop`, `toRight`, `toBottom`, `toBetween` , `toEvenly`, `toAround` ten kinds of atomic alignment, you can forget the concept of main axis and cross axis in traditional flex layout when you use them, you only need to have a sense of direction.

## Compare to Flexbox

Fower Layout base on Flexbox, Compare to Flexbox, it has several advantages:

- **Less Api**: You don't have to memorize all the APIs of Flexbox, just to remember 10 Atomic Props: `toCenter`、`toCenterX`、`toCenterY`、`toLeft`、`toTop`、`toRight`、`toBottom`、`toBetween`、`toEvenly`、`toAround`.
- **Easy to learn**: It's more intuitive，lower mental burden. No need to understand main axis and cross axis.

## Core Concept

Direction：`row、column`。

Alignment：`toCenter、toCenterX、toCenterY、toLeft、toTop、toRight、toBottom`、`toBetween`、`toEvenly`、`toAround`。

## Live Demo

```jsx live
<Box row toCenter bgGray100 square-200>
  <Box square-60 bgOrange400 rounded-8></Box>
  <Box square-80 bgBlue400 rounded-8></Box>
</Box>
```
