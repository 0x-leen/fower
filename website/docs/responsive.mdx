## About Responsive

Many CSS frameworks will claim to be Mobile-first and responsive. For example, two very famous CSS frameworks, Bootstrap and Bulma, describe themselves like this:

**Bootstrap**: Quickly design and customize responsive mobile-first sites with Bootstrap.

**Bulma**: Bulma is a mobile-first framework.

This is the responsive style of traditional CSS frameworks, most of which are only Grid System responsive styles. I think this is narrowly responsive. The truly responsive style should be responsive in every style, not just supporting Grid System responsiveness.

Each Atomic Props of Styli supports responsiveness, not just a container that supports responsiveness, which allows you to implement complex responsive interfaces more easily.

## Usage

Styli provides a very quick way of writing responsive styles. This way of writing is called Array Props. This way of writing may seem strange at first, but in fact it is very concise and efficient:

```jsx
<View>
  <View
    w={[
      1, // 100% below the smallest breakpoint
      1 / 2, // 50% from the next breakpoint and up
      1 / 3, // 33.33% from the next breakpoint and up
      1 / 4, // 25% from the next breakpoint and up
    ]}
  />

  {/* responsive font size */}
  <View f={[1, 2, 3, 4]} />

  {/* responsive margin */}
  <View m={[1, 2, 3, 4]} />

  {/* responsive padding */}
  <View p={[1, 2, 3, 4]} />
</View>
```

The `fontSize`, `margin`, `padding` and `width` above are all responsive. In fact, any Atomic Props can be written in this way to achieve responsiveness.

The Array Props is borrowed from [styled-system](https://styled-system.com/), thanks to styled-system for inventing such an elegant API.

## Endpoints

By default, responsive has four breakpoints:

```css
/* Small (sm) */
@media (min-width: 640px) {
  /* ... */
}

/* Medium (md) */
@media (min-width: 768px) {
}

/* Large (lg) */
@media (min-width: 1024px) {
  /* ... */
}

/* Extra Large (xl) */
@media (min-width: 1280px) {
  /* ... */
}
```
