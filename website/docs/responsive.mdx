## About Responsive

Many CSS frameworks will claim to be Mobile-first and responsive. For example, two very famous CSS frameworks, Bootstrap and Bulma, describe themselves like this:

**Bootstrap**: Quickly design and customize responsive mobile-first sites with Bootstrap.

**Bulma**: Bulma is a mobile-first framework.

This is the responsive style of traditional CSS frameworks, most of which are only Grid System responsive styles. I think this is narrowly responsive. The truly responsive style should be responsive in every style, not just supporting Grid System responsiveness.

Each Atomic Props of Styli supports responsiveness, not just a container that supports responsiveness, which allows you to implement complex responsive interfaces more easily.
