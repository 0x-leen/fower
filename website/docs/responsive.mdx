## About Responsive

Many CSS frameworks will claim to be Mobile-first and responsive. For example, two very famous CSS frameworks, Bootstrap and Bulma, describe themselves like this:

**Bootstrap**: Quickly design and customize responsive mobile-first sites with Bootstrap.

**Bulma**: Bulma is a mobile-first framework.

This is the responsive style of traditional CSS frameworks, most of which are only Grid System responsive styles. I think this is narrowly responsive. The truly responsive style should be responsive in every style, not just supporting Grid System responsiveness.

Each Atomic Props of Styli supports responsiveness, not just a container that supports responsiveness, which allows you to implement complex responsive interfaces more easily.

## Postfix

| Breakpoint postfix | Minimum width | CSS                                |
| ------------------ | ------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| sm                 | 640px         | @media (min-width: 640px) { ... }  |
| md                 | 768px         | @media (min-width: 768px) { ... }  |
| lg                 | 1024px        | @media (min-width: 1024px) { ... } |
| xl                 | 1280px        | @media (min-width: 1280px) { ... } |
| 2xl                | 1536px        | @media (min-width: 1536px) { ... } |

## Usage

Use `--{postfix}` like `--sm`, `--md`, `--lg` to set responsive style.

```jsx live
<Box textSM textLG--sm text4XL--md text6XL--lg>
  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
</Box>
```
