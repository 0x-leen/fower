---

Fower provides a dark mode out of the box, without even writing a line of "dark mode" related code.

This cool feature we call **Auto Dark Dode**.

Here is a live demo: https://fower-nextjs-example.vercel.app

## Setup

`autoDarkMode` is disabled by default, you can use `setConfig` to enable it.

```js
import { setConfig } from '@fower/core'

setConfig({
  autoDarkMode: true,
})
```

## How it work?

It uses the Fower color palette to automatically generate the dark mode style code. when you toggle your mode, color is generated by the below rule map:

```json
{
  "white": "black",
  "black": "white",
  "50": "900",
  "100": "800",
  "200": "700",
  "300": "600",
  "400": "500",
  "500": "400",
  "600": "300",
  "700": "200",
  "800": "100",
  "900": "50"
}
```

For example, when toggle mode, `red50` will become `red99`, `red100` will become `red800`, `green300` will become `green600`...
