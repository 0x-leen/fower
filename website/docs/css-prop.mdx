In most cases, you can use Atomic Props to complete UI development, but sometimes the Atomic Props provided by Styli cannot meet your needs. Because Styliâ€™s atomic Props are only a subset of CSS, we will not integrate all CSS features into Styli. Styli has a special Atomic Prop called `css` Prop, which supports all CSS features.

## Basic usage

The `css` Prop can receive a CSS object, in which you can write any CSS property. Some unpopular style properties that are not supported by Styli Atomic Props can be written in the `css` Prop.

```jsx live
<Text
  f-40
  red50
  css={{
    textShadow: '1px 0 5px #FC0',
    textDecoration: 'underline',
  }}
>
  Hi, Styli!
</Text>
```

:::info
CSS objects can be used in React-like frameworks only, not in Vue.js.

## Nested selector

Sometimes, you may want to use CSS nested selectors. Styli supports nested syntax similar to Less/Sass/Stylus, but Styli is using JS object which is more structured and flexible, not a string.

```jsx live
<View
  f-40
  css={{
    backgroundColor: '#edf2f7',
    ':hover': {
      backgroundColor: '#feebc8',
    },
    '.title': {
      fontWeight: 'bold',
    },
    span: {
      color: 'deeppink',
    },
  }}
>
  <div className="title">Nested demo</div>
  <span>Hi, Styli!</span>
</View>
```
