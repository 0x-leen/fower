Styli is great fit for React-like framework or library, Let's get started with [React](https://reactjs.org/).

## Installation

```bash
npm i @styli/react
```

## Usage

Now we're going to build a user profile card ui with `View`,`Image`,`Text`:

```tsx
import { View, Image, Text } from '@styli/react'
```

```jsx live
<View bgGray100 p6>
  <View toCenterY p-10 w-260 bgWhite rounded-10 shadowMD>
    <Image circle-48 src="/img/jobs.jpg" />
    <View ml-10>
      <View f-20 fontBold>
        Steve Jobs
      </View>
      <Text gray800>Co-founder of Apple Inc.</Text>
    </View>
  </View>
</View>
```

As you can see, we can build a more complex interface with few code. At first glance, you might say: "Isn't this a disguised inline style?" This is indeed similar to the inline style. They both write the style on JSX, but maybe this is the only similarity of them. The way to writing styles of Styli, I call it "Atomic props".

Compared with inline style, "Atomic props" has many advantages:

- **Less Code**, inline styles has a larger amount of code, which can easily make JSX messy, but "Atomic props" retains the simplicity of JSX and is more readable.

- **Style reuse**, using inline styles, it is easy to quickly expand the code, using "Atomic props", the code size will not expand too much as the project grows.

## Use in HTML elements

Atomic Props can also be used directly in html elements. In other words, you can directly add Atomic Props to html tags, the code is similar to the following:

```jsx
<div p6 f5 bgRed200>
  Use styli in HTML tag
</div>
```

To use Atomic Props in html elements, there are two ways to use them:

- Babel Preset
- JSX Pragma

### Babel Preset

The first way is to add a babel preset `@styli/babel-preset-styli` to the project by configuring babel.

```json title=".babelrc"
{
  "presets": ["@styli/babel-preset-styli"]
}
```

Then, you can use Atomic Props in HTML elements:

```jsx
import React from 'react'

export default () => {
  return (
    <div p6 f5 bgRed200>
      Use styli with Babel Preset
    </div>
  )
}
```

Note that if you want to get TypeScript type hints, you need to extend the attribute types of HTML by creating a new `d.ts` file in the project root directory, you can name it `index.d.ts`, the code is as follows:

```jsx title="index.d.ts"
import { AtomicProps } from '@styli/types';

declare module 'react' {
  interface HTMLAttributes<T> extends AtomicProps {}
}

```

### JSX Pragma

If you cannot control the babel configuration of the project, you can use the **JSX Pragma** instead:

```jsx
/** @jsx jsx */
import { jsx } from '@styli/react'

export default () => {
  return (
    <div p6 f5 bgOrange20>
      Use styli with JSX Pragma
    </div>
  )
}
```

Why the components above can use Atomic Props in HTML directly? It is because the following statement of `JSX Pragma` is added at the beginning of the component.

```jsx
/** @jsx jsx */
import { jsx } from '@styli/react'
```
